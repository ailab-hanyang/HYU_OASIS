## Evaluating on the NuPrompt Dataset

[NuPrompt](https://github.com/wudongming97/Prompt4Driving) is a referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) dataset where the task is predict 
sequences of 3D bounding boxes from a given text prompt. It is build on top of the NuScenes dataset. This is not code is not as polished as the rest of RefAV, and we don't provide an out-of-the box method for evaluation. Here is broadly how to reproduce our results.

### Download and Convert NuScenes to the Argoverse2 format.

Download the [NuScenes][https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes] dataset. 
`python run/nuprompt_conversion/nuscenes_to_av2.py`

### Run 3D tracker on NuScenes and convert to the Argoverse2 format.

We evaluate with two camera-only trackers: [PF-Track](https://github.com/TRI-ML/PF-Track) and [StreamPETR](https://github.com/exiawsh/StreamPETR). Follow the instructions in the respective repos to produce a tracking_results.json file. 

After obtaining the tracking results run
`python run/nuprompt_conversion/nuscenes_to_av2.py`

### Run RefProg 

Modify your `run/experiment_configs/experiments.yml` file to include an experiment with your NuScenes tracking results and NuPrompt descriptions.

`python run/run_experiment.py --exp exp62`

### Convert to RefAV format to NuPrompt format and Evaluate

`python run/nuprompt_conversion/refav_to_nuprompt.py`

Finally, run evaluation in the [NuPrompt](https://github.com/CainanD/Prompt4Driving-AV2) repo.
`python tools/eval_results_file.py`
